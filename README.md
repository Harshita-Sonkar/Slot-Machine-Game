# üí∏ Slot Machine Game ‚Äì Python

A fun slot machine game (which will give you the same thrill but without losing any money). This simple project tested a lot of my concepts in Python

## üê§ Tech Stack:

`Python`

## ‚ú® Features:

- You can enter the amount you want to deposit
- Then you can select how many lines you want to bet on and how much you want to bet on each line.
- If you win anything it adds onto your current balance and if you win nothing it tell you how much you have lost and updates your current balance
- It prints out the Slot machine and visually shows if there are matches
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Process:

I started off by simply defining a function to allow the user the deposit some amount of money. I had to make sure that they deposit a valid number. Then I had to focus on how many lines I want this Slot machine to have and allow the user to choose the number of lines they want to bet on.

Then I had to take input from the user, so they could decide how much money they want to bet on each line and then show hem the total amount that they are betting. 
Now, it was time to create the Slot machine. First, I started off by creating a 3 by 3 spin display and assigning symbols and what their values would be. It was not a very fair Slot spin count as the values are assigned randomly. 

After that, I had to make the machine to spin properly and display to the user. And then check if the user had won anything. For that, a list was created and the function would check one by one if in one row there are same symbols. And if there are, the correct value of that symbol but be multiplied with the lines selected by user. And then accordingly added o their balance. And if the user looses money, the correct amount should be deducted. 

Also allow the user to play on until they either want to cash out or end up broke!

This really cleared many concepts for me, and allowed me to think critically while solving basic problems. It allowed me to work on my problem-solving skills and learn that even when something seems difficult, there usually is an easy method to solve it.

## ü™¥ Improvements:

I can improve this project by building a GUI for it. I solely focused on the logic building, and next step would be to make it visually appealing so it is easier to understand and play!
